<p> So here's the story about Tycoon </p>

<p> You lead a small band of sturdy disciples across the land. 
They work with you on whatever mission you choose for the season.  
Each season you may do one of these things: </p>

<ul>
<li> Mine - retrieve minerals from the available natural resources </li>
<li> Harvest - retrieve available farm goods </li>
<li> Cultivate - work the land to increase harvest and your ability </li>
<li> Build - tend natural resources to increase mineral yield and your ability </li>
<li> Move - relocate to a nearby county, sometimes the grass IS greener </li>
</ul>

<p> Each county is marked with clues about its mineral resources, 
available crops, and annual yield.  Plot a path that takes you near
the maximum amount of resources before time runs out</p>

<p> Lead your band across the realm and amass as much Total Worth as you 
are able. If your efforts are highly effective, you may find yourself 
in the hall of fame.</p>

<p>You have a fixed number of turns (48 right now) and you gain resources
for many of the operations you may declare.</p>

If you are having trouble getting a high score in the game, try to answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much does your crop store increase when you Harvest?
</li>
<li>How much does your mineral store increase when you Mine?
</li>
<li>How much does your Total Worth increase when you Mine or Harvest?
</li>
<li>How much does the crop allowance in your county decrease when you Harvest?
</li>
<li>How much does the mineral allowance in your county decrease when you Mine?
</li>

</ul>
